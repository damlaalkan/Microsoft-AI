Setting up the requirements

Computer Vision client documentation by MS  

Download latest Python

Open cmd and run

c:\python39\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip --user

To update pip installer

Run still in cmd as admin (always try to run it as admin sometimes --user command is not accepted)

pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision --user

To install computer vision libraries for python

Download Anaconda

conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

Install Jupyter with Anacoda command prompt

Install and set up a virtual environment for python
Installing packages using pip and virtual environments — Python Packaging User Guide

On cmd run these

py -m pip install --user virtualenv

Installs the virtual environment(venv) package

py -m venv env

Creates the venv folder named "env"

.\env\Scripts\activate

Activates and enters the venv on cmd (run cmd as admin)

Now on the venv install packages for python like azure, pillow, matplotlib (run cmd as admin)

.\env\scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip (update pip installer in venv)

pip install requests

pip install pillow

pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision

pip install ipykernel

python -m pip install -U matplotlib

pip install numpy==1.19.3 (admin cmd needed) (downgrade for numpy latest version doesn't work)

python -m ipykernel install --user --name=env (adds the kernel to jupyter)

Launch Jupyter notebook and select env which is the newly created venv



Now the documented import step but with env

Create a new Python file—quickstart-file.py, for example. Then open it in your preferred editor or IDE and import the following libraries.

From <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts-sdk/client-library?tabs=visual-studio&pivots=programming-language-python> 


from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision import ComputerVisionClient
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.models import OperationStatusCodes
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.models import VisualFeatureTypes
from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials

from array import array
import os
from PIL import Image
import sys
import time

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

You can now continue following the documentation entering the subscription_key and endpoint.
